# Web-project
This web application project is basically portfolio type which I managed, design and developed using most prominent front end development tools. This project required only front-end development using HTML, CSS-Bootstrap, JavaScript and Ajax for designing, animation and form handling for feedbacks. Google API was used for fetching the map location.
